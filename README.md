## Others

The following functionalities are not "features", they are basically techniques that may be of interest to you to explore, understand and apply in the development of your driver.

- Searching for a "Zw" api not exported from `ntoskrnl.exe` at runtime.
- Reflective Loading.
- Support for mapping the driver in memory.

## Installation
- Install Rust from [**here**](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- Then follow the instructions provided by [**microsoft**](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)

## Supported Platforms
- ✅ Windows 10 / 11 (x64)

## Build Instructions

To build the project, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. 

#### Driver
To build the driver, first go to the `driver` folder and then run the following command (When you do the first build you have to be as administrator, but after that you won't need to):
```sh
cargo make default --release
```

This driver can be mapped using `kdmapper` among other exploit tools, for example, to put mapping support, use the command:
```sh
cargo make default --release --features mapper
```

#### Client
To build the client, first go into the `client` folder, then run the following command:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

Since some features of the rootkit are not supported due to the controller mapping, use the following command to build the client with only the commands that can be executed with the mapping:
```sh
cargo build --release --features mapper
```

## Setup Instructions

#### Enable Test Mode or Test Signing Mode 

```
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

#### [Optional] Debug via Windbg

```
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings net hostip:<IP> port:<PORT>
```

#### Create / Start Service

You can use [Service Control Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-control-manager) or [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=157.htm) to load your driver.
